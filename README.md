About:

  Gravity Notepad is a program that functions almost identical to Notepad (some features like time and date and status bar are missing) but it has two major difference which are:
    1. It has gravity simulation so the text you type falls to the bottom of the window.
    2. With "Ctrl+W" a blank character is placed (unicode code "U+2800").The purpose to add this is so that you can have blank lines and such and not have all your characters just fall to the floor.

Keyboard Shortcuts:
  1. Ctrl+C = Copy
  2. Ctrl+V = Paste
  3. Ctrl+X = Cut
  4. Ctrl+W = Create blank character
  5. Ctrl+S = Save File
  6. Ctrl+N = New Window
  7. Ctrl+O = Open File

How To Type:
  To type normally you need to type the last of your characters first as due to gravity everything falls downwards. whenever a blank line or some other sepeartation is needed to prevent the chars from falling use Ctrl+W to create blank characters in such
  a way that the characters (below which separation is needed) will sit on top of the blank characters.
